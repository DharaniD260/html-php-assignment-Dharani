23. Prioritize the use of GET and POST arguments in PHP with a real time example.



<?php  
// Simulating GET and POST without a form  
$_GET['color'] = "Blue";  
$_POST['name'] = "Dharani";  
  
echo "GET: Your favorite color is " . $_GET['color'] . "\n";  
echo "POST: Hello, " . $_POST['name'] . "!";  
?>  output:
GET: Your favorite color is Blue
POST: Hello, Dharani!

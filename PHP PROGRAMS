1)1. Show the output for the following snippet.
<? php
$capital=67;
print(“Variable capital is $capital”);
print(“Variable CaPiTaL is $CaPiTaL”);
?>

output:
Variable capital is 67 Variable CaPiTal is


2)Create a PHP program to display the division table using for-loop.
1 2 3
1 1 0.5 0.33
2 2 1 0.66
3 3 1.5 1

code: <?php
echo "  1 2 3\n";
for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
    echo $i . " "; 
    for ($j = 1; $j <= 3; $j++) {
        $result = $i / $j;
        echo round($result, 2) . " ";
    }
    echo "\n";
}
?>
output: 
 1 2 3
1 1 0.5 0.33 
2 2 1 0.67 
3 3 1.5 1 

4. Predict the output of the following snippet:
<?php
$animal = “antelope”; $animal_heads = 1; $animal_legs = 4;
echo“The $animal has $animal_heads head(s).”;
echo“The $animal has $animal_legs leg(s).”;
?>php

output:The antelope has 1 head(s).The antelope has 4 leg(s).

5. You are building a website where users can calculate the total cost of their purchases.
Write a PHP program that takes the price and quantity of three items from the user and
calculates the subtotal, tax (10% of the subtotal),and the total cost (subtotal + tax).
Display the results to the user.

<?php
$price1 = 100;
$qty1   = 2;

$price2 = 50;
$qty2   = 3;

$price3 = 20;
$qty3   = 5;

$subtotal = ($price1 * $qty1) + ($price2 * $qty2) + ($price3 * $qty3);
$tax = $subtotal * 0.10;
$total = $subtotal + $tax;

echo "--- Purchase Summary ---\n";
echo "Subtotal: ₹" . number_format($subtotal, 2) . "\n";
echo "Tax (10%): ₹" . number_format($tax, 2) . "\n";
echo "Total Cost: ₹" . number_format($total, 2) . "\n";
?>

output:
--- Purchase Summary ---
Subtotal: ₹450.00
Tax (10%): ₹45.00
Total Cost: ₹495.00

8. A customer visits a shop to buy a soft drink; he has two options:
Drink A cost is Rs.25 and the size of the bottle is 11.
Drink B cost is Rs.23 and its size of the bottle is 9.
Which drink should he choose to save money? Solve this problem using function deal ()

<?php
function deal() {
  $costA = 25;
  $sizeA = 11;

  $costB = 23;
  $sizeB = 9;

  $valueA = $costA / $sizeA;
  $valueB = $costB / $sizeB;

  if ($valueA < $valueB) {
    echo "Drink A is a better deal.";
  } else {
    echo "Drink B is a better deal.";
  }
}

deal();
?>

output:Drink A is a better deal.


9. Predict the output of the following snippet:
$this = “this”; $that = “that”; $the_other = 2.2000000000;
print(“$this,$not_set,$that+$the_other”);

output:this,,that+2.2


10. Develop a program to check student grades based on marks using a loop.
<?php
$marks = [85, 72, 60, 48, 30];

for ($i = 0; $i < count($marks); $i++) {
    $mark = $marks[$i];

    echo "Student " . ($i + 1) . ": Marks = $mark, Grade = ";

    if ($mark >= 80) {
        echo "A";
    } elseif ($mark >= 60) {
        echo "B";
    } elseif ($mark >= 40) {
        echo "C";
    } else {
        echo "Fail<br>";
    }
}
?>

output:
Student 1: Marks = 85, Grade = A  
Student 2: Marks = 72, Grade = B  
Student 3: Marks = 60, Grade = B  
Student 4: Marks = 48, Grade = C  
Student 5: Marks = 30, Grade = Fail

11. Develop a PHP program to show days of the week using switch cases.
<?php
$dayNumber = 3; 

switch ($dayNumber) {
    case 1:
        echo "Sunday";
        break;
    case 2:
        echo "Monday";
        break;
    case 3:
        echo "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        echo "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 5:
        echo "Thursday";
        break;
    case 6:
        echo "Friday";
        break;
    case 7:
        echo "Saturday";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Invalid day number!";
}
?>
output: tuesday

12. Write a program to check student grade based on marks:
Conditions:
If marks are 75% or more, the grade will be First Class.
If marks between 60% to 74%, grade will be second class.
If marks between 40% to 59%, grade will be third class.
If marks are less than 40%, students will be Fail.

<?php
$marks = 68; 

echo "Marks: $marks";
echo "Grade: ";

if ($marks >= 75) {
    echo "First Class";
} elseif ($marks >= 60 && $marks < 75) {
    echo "Second Class";
} elseif ($marks >= 40 && $marks < 60) {
    echo "Third Class";
} else {
    echo "Fail";
}
?>

output: Marks: 68Grade: Second Class
